A concert of triumph and drama, a concert that will move you.\r\nWhy do we adore Tchaikovsky''s Fifth Symphony so much? Because he speaks directly to us with the orchestra as his voice. Sorrow, joy, passion, triumph, the forces of Fate - it''s all there in the music. It''s there in the striking dramatic gestures, fabulous melodies and irresistible waltz rhythms; it''s there in the sheer intensity of emotion.\r\nProkofiev''s second violin concerto provides the bittersweet balance to Tchaikovsky''s indulgence and sees the return to Sydney of Canadian violinist James Ehnes. This is music that requires perfect, understated poise from its soloist. It hides its virtuosity under a thrilling series of melodies - sometimes elegantly singing, sometimes wildly dancing, but always pure Prokofiev.

The goal was to offer an open place for creative talent. From this day, the church building on Weteringschans was a place that attracted youngsters, audiences and artists from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Europe and the rest of the world. In the 40 years that followed, Paradiso has become a pop podium, a club and a cultural center in one. <br /><br />The <strong>Main Hall</strong> has a capacity of 1500 and hosts world famous rock, folk, soul, country, reggae and blues heroes such as Al Green (2008), Jerry Lee Lewis (2004) and Smokey Robinson (2007) but also style icons like Grace Jones (2009). This hall is often filled to the brim for popular newcomers such as Queens Of The Stone Age (2002, 2005), White Stripes (2003), Last Shadow Puppets (2008) and Lady Gaga (2009). We also have regular visitors like Maceo Parker, George Clinton, De Dijk and Van Dik Hout who come back every year to play in the special atmosphere of the old church.<br /><br />In the <strong>Small Hall</strong> with a capacity of 250, we host intimate and often magical concerts. Up and coming talent plays here, often as their first step before making it big. After a successful concert in the Small Hall of Paradiso, they return to play in the Main Hall. Franz Ferdinand and Kings of Leon are just two of the many examples of artists who started out in our Small Hall, then played the Main Hall and the big stadiums soon after. Also, the Small Hall is home to eccentric artists, young and old, who will never play a big music dome but are extremely special nevertheless. For example, Paradiso''s Small Hall will always have a place for artists like Johnny Dowd, Michael Gira (Swans), Bob Log III and Steve Wynn.<br /><br />Throughout the year, the big stream of concerts and other events is changed up with festivals, such as the Britpop oriented London Calling festival and 5 days off, the festival for electronic music and media art.</p>', 'Paradiso, Amsterdam', '', 'paradiso-amsterdam_1391634526.jpg', 1, 610, '82.95.199.158', '2013-11-07 23:59:31', '2014-08-08 19:37:38', 610, 3, 1, 610, '2014-08-22 21:04:24', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

Situated on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour, close to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the facility is adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, between Sydney and Farm Coves.<br /><br />Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the facility formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon''s 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The NSW Government, led by Premier Joseph Cahill authorised work to begin in 1958, with Utzon directing construction. The government''s decision to build Utzon''s design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect''s ultimate resignation.<br /><br />Though its name suggests a single venue, the project comprises multiple performance venues which together are among the busiest performing arts centres in the world — hosting over 1,500 performances each year attended by some 1.2 million people. The venues produce and present a wide range of in-house productions and accommodate numerous performing arts companies, including four key resident companies: Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than seven million people visit the site each year, with 300,000 people participating annually in a guided tour of the facility.<br /><br />Identified as one of the 20th century''s most distinctive buildings and one of the most famous performing arts centres in the world, the facility is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, under the auspices of the New South Wales Ministry of the Arts.</span></span></p>', '', '', 'sydney-opera-house_1696461243.jpg', 1, 610, '82.95.199.158', '2013-11-08 10:35:33', '2014-08-08 21:54:44', 610, 5, 1, 610, '2014-08-22 21:08:24', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),
